# Minimizing Microservice Vulnerabilities

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

Microservices architecture in Kubernetes introduces unique security challenges. Securing microservices requires enforcing **secure coding practices**, **container security**, and **API protection** to reduce exposure to attacks.

This section covers best practices to **harden microservices** against common vulnerabilities and threats.

## Topics Covered

### **Secure Development Practices**

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

- Implement **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** to identify vulnerabilities in code.
- Enforce **peer code reviews** to detect security issues early in the development process.

### **Dependency Management**

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like **OWASP Dependency-Check**, **Trivy**, or **Snyk** to scan for outdated or insecure libraries.

### **Container Security**

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

- Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Use **distroless images** or minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.

### **Secure Configuration Management**

- Avoid **hardcoded credentials** in configuration files and source code.
- Use Kubernetes **Secrets** or external secret management tools like **Vault**.
