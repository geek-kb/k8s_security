# Cluster Setup and Hardening

Securing a Kubernetes cluster starts with properly configuring the **control plane**, **worker nodes**, and **network policies**. Misconfigurations at the infrastructure level can expose critical components to attacks, leading to potential cluster compromise.

This section covers essential security best practices for Kubernetes cluster hardening.

## Topics Covered

### [CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/cis_benchmark_for_k8s.md)

Following the **Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark** provides baseline security guidelines for Kubernetes cluster configurations.

### [CIS Benchmark with kube-bench](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/cis_benchmark_kube_bench.md)

Automating compliance checks using **kube-bench** ensures that your cluster adheres to the **CIS Benchmark** recommendations.

### [Kubelet Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/kubelet_security.md)

Securing the **Kubelet** prevents unauthorized access to node-level resources and helps enforce **runtime security policies**.

### [Network Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/network_policies.md)

Applying **NetworkPolicies** restricts pod-to-pod communication, limiting an attacker's ability to move laterally within the cluster.

### [Pod Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/pod_security/pod_security_standards.md)

Enforcing **Pod Security Standards (PSS)** ensures that workloads comply with **security best practices** such as restricting **privileged containers** and enforcing **non-root execution**.

### [Runtime Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/runtime_security/intro.md)

Monitoring and protecting workloads in **real time** ensures that any **suspicious activities** are detected and mitigated before they escalate.

### [Secrets Management](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/secrets_management.md)

Storing **secrets securely** prevents exposure of sensitive data such as **API keys**, **database credentials**, and **encryption keys**.

### [Understanding CIS Benchmarks](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/what_are_cis_benchmarks.md)

A deeper look into how **CIS Benchmarks** help standardize Kubernetes security and reduce misconfigurations.
