# Service Mesh Security

A **service mesh** provides **secure service-to-service communication** within a Kubernetes cluster. Tools like **Istio, Linkerd, and Consul** enable **mTLS (mutual TLS), traffic encryption, and policy enforcement**.

## Security Features of a Service Mesh

### 1. Mutual TLS (mTLS)

Encrypts **all service-to-service traffic** within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

### 2. Zero-Trust Networking

- Enforce **identity-based access controls** between services.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** at the service level.

### 3. Monitor and Audit Service Traffic

- Use **Istioâ€™s observability features** to **monitor all inter-service communication**.

Service Meshes **strengthen Kubernetes security** by providing **encryption, access control, and monitoring**.
