# kube-hunter

**kube-hunter** is an open-source Kubernetes penetration testing tool developed by Aqua Security. It simulates attacker behavior to identify misconfigurations, insecure setups, and potential vulnerabilities in Kubernetes clusters. kube-hunter is particularly useful for discovering open ports, exposed services, and weak access controls that may lead to lateral movement or privilege escalation.

It supports both passive and active hunting modes, enabling safe inspection or deep penetration testing of environments.

## Usage

You can run kube-hunter either **remotely** (from outside the cluster) or **from within a pod** for internal hunting.

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install kube-hunter
```

### Run in Remote Scanning Mode

```bash
kube-hunter --remote <target-node-ip>
```

This mode scans for publicly exposed services and ports on a given IP.

### Run Inside the Cluster

Deploy kube-hunter as a pod inside the cluster for internal reconnaissance:

```bash
kubectl run kube-hunter --rm -it \
  --image=aquasec/kube-hunter \
  --serviceaccount=kube-hunter \
  --restart=Never
```

### Run in Active Hunting Mode

```bash
kube-hunter --active
```

This mode simulates real attacks and should **only be run in non-production environments** with permission.

## Example Findings

kube-hunter may report:

- Exposed Dashboard or Kubelet APIs
- Anonymous access to the API Server
- Accessible etcd endpoints
- Insecure use of `hostPath` volumes
- Privileged containers or pods

---

## Best Practices

- Use kube-hunter in **non-production** or isolated environments only.
- Perform periodic scans to identify newly introduced misconfigurations.
- Run both internal and external scans to test different attack surfaces.
- Combine with other tools (e.g., Trivy, kube-bench) for complete posture analysis.
- Regularly update kube-hunter to benefit from new attack signatures and fixes.
- Integrate with CI pipelines for proactive misconfiguration detection (optional).

## Summary

kube-hunter helps security teams and cluster operators identify Kubernetes misconfigurations before attackers do. Itâ€™s a valuable addition to Kubernetes security assessments, especially during penetration testing, threat modeling, or pre-production readiness checks.
