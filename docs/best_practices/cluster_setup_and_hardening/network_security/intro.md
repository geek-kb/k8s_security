# Network Security in Kubernetes

Securing network communication in Kubernetes is critical to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and lateral movement by attackers. Kubernetes networking is complex, with multiple layers of communication including **Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service, and External-to-Internal traffic**. This section covers essential **network security strategies** for Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Topics in Network Security

### [Network Policies](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/network_policies)

Network Policies provide **fine-grained control** over **Pod-to-Pod** and **Pod-to-External** communication, allowing administrators to enforce **least privilege networking**.

### [Ingress Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/ingress_security)

Ingress security focuses on securing **external access** to the cluster by implementing **TLS, authentication, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and rate limiting**.

### [Egress Control in Kubernetes](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/egress_control)

Egress security restricts outbound traffic from **Pods to external services**, reducing the risk of **data exfiltration and malware communication**.

### [Service Mesh Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/service_mesh_security)

Service meshes like **Istio, Linkerd, and Consul** provide **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, **zero-trust networking**, and **observability** for internal service communication.

### [DNS Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/dns_security)

CoreDNS is the default Kubernetes DNS provider. Hardening it against **DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and unauthorized modifications** is essential.

### [DDoS Mitigation in Kubernetes](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/ddos_mitigation)

Kubernetes workloads can be targeted by **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks**. Learn how to mitigate these risks with **rate limiting, WAFs, and auto-scaling**.

By implementing these best practices, Kubernetes administrators can **harden the clusterâ€™s networking model**, enforce **zero-trust principles**, and **minimize attack surfaces**.
