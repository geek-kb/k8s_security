# Exposed Kubernetes Dashboard Mitigation

This guide provides best practices for securing the Kubernetes Dashboard and preventing it from becoming an entry point for attackers.

---

## Restrict Network Access

- Do not expose the Dashboard using `kubectl proxy --address=0.0.0.0` on a public network.
- Avoid exposing the Dashboard via a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.
- Use firewall rules or cloud security groups to restrict access to internal IP ranges or VPN-only networks.

## Enforce Authentication

- Require authentication via a secure method such as token-based login or OIDC integration.
- Avoid using static `cluster-admin` tokens for Dashboard access.
- Disable the Dashboard entirely in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Use Least Privilege for the Dashboard Service Account

- Do not bind the Dashboard's service account to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.
- Use scoped RoleBindings tied to specific namespaces and limit permissions to only those necessary.
- Periodically audit the permissions and bindings associated with the Dashboard.

## Enable Policy Enforcement

- Use policy engines like Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper or Kyverno to block creation of privileged pods or overly permissive RBAC bindings.
- Deny access to known dangerous patterns such as `privileged: true` or use of `hostPID: true`.

## Monitor and Audit Access

- Enable audit logging to track Dashboard usage and access patterns.
- Monitor for abnormal behavior, such as pod creation from the Dashboard or use of the exec feature.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, Kubernetes administrators can greatly reduce the risk posed by an exposed or over-privileged Dashboard, even in development or staging clusters.
