# Securing Kubernetes Admission Controllers

**Admission controllers** in Kubernetes play a crucial role in **validating and mutating requests** before they are persisted in the cluster. **Misconfigurations** in admission controllers can allow attackers to bypass security policies, deploy unauthorized workloads, and escalate privileges.

---

## 1. Use Validating and Mutating Admission Controllers Wisely

**Issue:** Some admission controllers allow automatic modifications that may introduce security risks.<br/>
**Fix:** Only enable necessary **Validating and Mutating Webhooks** and audit their changes.

### Secure Webhook Admission Control

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: restrict-host-paths
webhooks:
  - name: restrict-host-paths.k8s.io
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        resources: ["pods"]
        operations: ["CREATE"]
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: admission-controller
        namespace: kube-system
        path: "/validate"
    admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
    failurePolicy: "Fail"
```

### Why It Matters

- **Ensures** that security policies are enforced before workloads are created.<br/>
- **Prevents** insecure configurations from being automatically modified.

---

## 2. Restrict Admission Controller Webhook Access

**Issue:** An attacker can modify admission controller webhooks to bypass security policies.<br/>
**Fix:** Use **RBAC** to limit access to webhook configurations.

### Secure Webhook RBAC Policy

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: kube-system
  name: webhook-admin
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["admissionregistration.k8s.io"]
    resources:
      ["validatingwebhookconfigurations", "mutatingwebhookconfigurations"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

### Why It Matters

- **Prevents** unauthorized modifications to security-critical components.<br/>
- **Limits** who can change admission controller behavior.

---

## 3. Set FailurePolicy to "Fail" for Critical Webhooks

**Issue:** If a webhook fails to respond, Kubernetes may allow requests by default.<br/>
**Fix:** Use `failurePolicy: Fail` to block unauthorized actions when an admission controller is unavailable.

### Secure Webhook Failure Policy

```yaml
failurePolicy: "Fail"
```

### Why It Matters

- **Prevents** attackers from bypassing security checks by disrupting webhooks.<br/>
- **Ensures** workloads are properly validated before being deployed.

---

## 4. Monitor Admission Controller Logs and Audit Changes

**Issue:** Unauthorized changes to admission controllers may go undetected.<br/>
**Fix:** Enable **audit logging** for admission controller events.

### Enable Audit Logs

```bash
--audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
--audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
```

### Why It Matters

- **Detects** suspicious modifications to admission controller policies.<br/>
- **Provides** visibility into rejected or modified API requests.

---

## Conclusion

**Securing Kubernetes Admission Controllers** is critical for **enforcing security policies, preventing unauthorized workloads, and protecting cluster integrity**. By **restricting webhook access, enforcing failure policies, enabling audit logs, and carefully configuring admission controllers**, you can significantly **reduce attack surfaces**.
