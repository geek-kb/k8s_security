# Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Security

Monitoring, logging, and runtime security are essential components of a **defense-in-depth** strategy for Kubernetes. By continuously collecting and analyzing data from clusters, administrators can detect **anomalies**, **unauthorized access**, and **potential attacks** before they escalate.

This section provides guidance on **effective observability** and **real-time security monitoring** in Kubernetes environments.

## Topics Covered

### **Monitoring Kubernetes Clusters**

- Use **Prometheus** for collecting cluster and application metrics.
- Set up **Grafana dashboards** for real-time visualization of system health.
- Configure **alerts** using **Alertmanager** to notify administrators of suspicious activities.

### **Logging Best Practices**

- Aggregate logs from **pods, nodes, and control plane components** using **Fluentd**, **Logstash**, or **Loki**.
- Store logs in a **centralized and immutable** logging system for auditability.
- Implement **log rotation and retention policies** to manage storage efficiently.

### **Runtime Security**

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

- Use **Falco** to detect unexpected process executions, privilege escalations, and network anomalies.
- Implement **AppArmor** or **SELinux** for process-level confinement and enforcement.
- Enable **audit logging** in the Kubernetes API server to track **security-related events**.

### **Threat Detection and Incident Response**

- Set up **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor for malicious activity.
- Automate incident response workflows using **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions**.
- Conduct **regular security audits** to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
