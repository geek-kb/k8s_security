# Falco

**Falco** is an open-source runtime security engine developed by the CNCF. It detects unexpected or malicious behavior in Kubernetes clusters by monitoring **kernel-level system calls** and applying customizable security rules. Falco helps identify real-time threats such as container escapes, privilege escalations, cryptomining, and filesystem tampering.

By combining behavioral detection with Kubernetes context, Falco provides deep visibility into whatâ€™s happening inside containers and nodes at runtime.

---

## Use Cases

- Detect container breakouts and privilege escalations.
- Monitor runtime behavior for policy violations.
- Audit workload actions like shell access or sensitive file modification.
- Integrate with alerting and incident response systems.

---

## Usage Examples

### Run Falco as a DaemonSet in Kubernetes

```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --create-namespace
```

### Example Rule: Alert on Shell Spawned in a Container

```yaml
- rule: Terminal shell in container
  desc: A shell was spawned inside a container
  condition: container.id != host and proc.name in (bash, sh, zsh)
  output: "Shell spawned in container (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING
```

### View Real-Time Events

```bash
kubectl logs -n falco -l app=falco
```

### Export Events to Alerting Tools

Use Falco plugins or sidecars to forward alerts to:

- Slack
- Prometheus
- Elasticsearch
- Syslog
- Webhooks

---

## Best Practices

- **Deploy as a DaemonSet:** Monitor all nodes and workloads.
- **Use tailored rulesets:** Tune rules based on your environment to reduce false positives.
- **Integrate alerts into SIEM or incident response:** Forward alerts for real-time visibility and action.
- **Audit for shell access and sensitive operations:** Detect unexpected access to the host or critical paths.
- **Combine with Admission Controllers:** Prevent known-bad workloads at deploy-time and detect runtime issues with Falco.
