# Tetragon

**Tetragon** is an open-source, Kubernetes-native **eBPF-based security observability and runtime enforcement tool** developed by the Cilium project. It allows security teams to monitor system and network activity in real time, detect malicious behavior, and enforce policies dynamicallyâ€”without modifying application code.

Tetragon integrates tightly with Kubernetes, delivering deep visibility into process-level activity, container lifecycle events, file access, and network communication.

---

## Use Cases

- Detect unexpected process executions in containers.
- Enforce runtime policies like blocking unauthorized binaries.
- Trace container and host activity at the syscall level.
- Observe DNS, TCP, and HTTP traffic per workload.
- Correlate events with Kubernetes metadata (pods, namespaces, labels).

---

## Usage Examples

### Install Tetragon with Helm

```bash
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io
helm install tetragon cilium/tetragon --namespace kube-system
```

### Example: Log All Executed Binaries

Tetragon emits events for executed processes using eBPF hooks:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=tetragon -f
```

Example output:

```
Process exec detected: /usr/bin/curl in pod nginx-1234 with UID 1000
```

### Example: Enforce Runtime Policy

Block execution of `nc` (netcat) across all containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v1alpha1
kind: TracingPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-netcat
spec:
  selectors:
    matchBinary: ["/usr/bin/nc"]
  action: Block
```

Apply the policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f block-netcat.yaml
```

## Best Practices

- **Deploy cluster-wide:** Use the DaemonSet to monitor all nodes and containers.
- **Use granular policies:** Apply Kubernetes-native enforcement using labels, namespaces, and container metadata.
- **Integrate with observability pipelines:** Send logs to SIEM or alerting systems for incident response.
- **Use in combination with audit logs:** Correlate Tetragon events with Kubernetes audit logs for full visibility.
- **Keep eBPF programs updated:** Monitor upstream releases for security and kernel compatibility updates.
