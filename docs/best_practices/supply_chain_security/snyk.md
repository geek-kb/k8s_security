# Snyk

**Snyk** is a comprehensive **developer-friendly security platform** that scans for **vulnerabilities, license issues, and misconfigurations** across code, open-source dependencies, containers, and Kubernetes configurations. It helps teams shift security left by integrating directly into CI/CD pipelines and development environments.

In Kubernetes environments, Snyk plays a critical role in **securing container images and IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**, including **Kubernetes manifests** and **Helm charts**.

---

## Usage

### 1. Install Snyk CLI

```bash
npm install -g snyk
```

Authenticate your CLI with:

```bash
snyk auth
```

---

### 2. Scan Kubernetes Manifests and Helm Charts

```bash
snyk iac test path/to/k8s/deployment.yaml
```

Or for Helm:

```bash
snyk iac test path/to/chart/
```

Snyk identifies issues such as:

- Containers running as root
- Privileged mode enabled
- Lack of resource limits
- Insecure hostPath mounts

---

### 3. Scan Container Images

```bash
snyk container test <image-name>
```

This checks for known vulnerabilities in OS packages and language dependencies (e.g., Alpine, Ubuntu, Python, Node.js, etc.).

Example:

```bash
snyk container test nginx:latest
```

---

### 4. Monitor for Fixable Issues

You can monitor projects continuously:

```bash
snyk monitor
```

This sends results to the Snyk UI and alerts you when new vulnerabilities are discovered in used images or dependencies.

---

### 5. Integrate with CI/CD and Git Repositories

Snyk integrates with:

- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, and more

Add a GitHub Action, for example:

```yaml
- name: Snyk Container Scan
  uses: snyk/actions/docker@master
  with:
    image: my-app:latest
    args: --file=Dockerfile
  env:
    SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Best Practices

- Include `snyk iac test` in pull request workflows to catch misconfigurations early.
- Scan all **production images** before publishing to container registries.
- Set up **monitoring** on critical workloads for real-time vulnerability awareness.
- Regularly review and patch fixable issues identified in Kubernetes resources and base images.
- Combine with `kubectl` plugins or GitOps workflows to embed scanning into cluster updates.
