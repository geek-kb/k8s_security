# Kubernetes Security Best Practices

Securing a Kubernetes environment requires a multi-layered approach that addresses the cluster infrastructure, workloads, and runtime security. This section provides best practices to mitigate risks and improve security at every level of your deployment.

## Structure of Best Practices

This section is organized into several key areas of Kubernetes security:

### [Cluster Setup and Hardening](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/)

Learn how to harden your Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes to minimize security vulnerabilities. Topics include the **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**, **Kubelet security**, **Pod security**, and **network policies**.

### [Minimizing Microservice Vulnerabilities](/docs/best_practices/minimize_microservice_vulnerabilities/)

Explore security best practices for securing containerized applications, including **supply chain security**, **container image scanning**, and **application runtime security**.

### [Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Security](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/)

Implement effective **logging, monitoring, and alerting** to detect security incidents and respond in real-time.

### [Supply Chain Security](/docs/best_practices/supply_chain_security/)

Protect your software supply chain by securing container images, dependencies, and CI/CD pipelines.

### [System Hardening](/docs/best_practices/system_hardening/)

Strengthen the overall security posture of your Kubernetes infrastructure by enforcing **least privilege access**, **host security**, and **API hardening**.

## How to Use This Section

Each topic contains a structured guide with **step-by-step configurations**, **best practices**, and **security recommendations**. Follow these guides to improve your Kubernetes security and align with industry best practices.
