# Kubernetes Security Best Practices

Securing Kubernetes environments requires a defense-in-depth strategy that spans infrastructure setup, workload deployment, runtime operations, and software supply chain integrity. This section introduces foundational best practices that support secure-by-default cluster architectures and reduce the risk of compromise throughout the Kubernetes lifecycle.

## Why Kubernetes Security Best Practices Matter

Kubernetes offers powerful orchestration capabilities, but its flexibility also introduces complexity. Without strong operational security controls, clusters can be vulnerable to:

- Configuration drift
- Escalated privileges
- Insecure container workloads
- Undetected runtime threats
- Compromised third-party dependencies

Implementing Kubernetes security best practices helps mitigate these risks by enforcing security controls and hardening each layer of the stack.

## This section covers the following topics

- **[Cluster Setup and Hardening](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/intro)**: Secure the Kubernetes control plane, workloads, and networking using CIS benchmarks and validated tooling.
- **[System Hardening](/docs/best_practices/system_hardening/intro)**: Lock down the host operating system and node configurations.
- **[Microservice Security](/docs/best_practices/minimize_microservice_vulnerabilities/intro)**: Minimize application-layer vulnerabilities and reduce workload risk.
- **[Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Security](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/intro)**: Gain visibility into cluster activity and respond to anomalies in real time.
- **[Supply Chain Security](/docs/best_practices/supply_chain_security/intro)**: Protect workloads from tampering, malware, and untrusted sources during the build and deployment process.

These sections contain in-depth articles, tools, and actionable controls mapped to real-world threats.

## Security Principles Across the Stack

These best practices align with key cloud-native security principles:

1. **Secure by Default**
   - Use tools and settings that prioritize safety, like restricted admission controllers and default-deny network policies.

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Assign only the minimum permissions required to users, workloads, and service accounts.

3. **Defense in Depth**
   - Apply layered security from infrastructure and cluster components to application code and containers.

4. **Continuous Verification**
   - Monitor workloads and enforce policy throughout the runtime lifecycle, not just at deployment time.

## Conclusion

This section equips teams with tactical and strategic guidance for improving Kubernetes security posture. By following these best practices, organizations can reduce risk, increase visibility, and build resilient, compliant, and secure cloud-native systems.
