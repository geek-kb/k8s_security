# Kubernetes Security Best Practices

Kubernetes security requires a **layered approach** to protect clusters, workloads, and infrastructure. This section provides **best practices** aligned with industry standards, including **CIS Benchmarks**, **Pod Security Standards**, and **runtime hardening**.

### Topics Covered

- **[Cluster Setup and Hardening](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/cis_benchmark_for_k8s)**: Secure Kubernetes installations using CIS guidelines.
- **[Pod Security and Runtime Protection](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/pod_security/pod_security_standards)**: Apply pod security policies and container runtime protection.
- **[Network Security](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/network_security/network_policies)**: Enforce network segmentation and traffic restrictions.
- **[Supply Chain Security](/docs/best_practices/supply_chain_security)**: Prevent supply chain attacks in CI/CD workflows.
- **[Monitoring and Logging](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security)**: Detect threats using logs and runtime monitoring tools.

These **best practices help minimize attack surfaces** and ensure Kubernetes environments remain **resilient to threats**.
