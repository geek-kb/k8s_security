# Introduction to Kubernetes Security

Welcome to **K8s Security**, a resource created by **Itai Ganot** to provide comprehensive guides and best practices for securing Kubernetes environments.  
This site is dedicated to helping developers, DevOps engineers, and Kubernetes administrators implement robust security measures aligned with the principles of the **Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)** certification and beyond.  
The topics that are relevant for the CKS certification are marked as such.

The site is still under development as many CKS-related topics are not yet covered.  
I'm doing my best to add the missing content as quickly as possible.
Thanks for your patience.

The information will soon be up to date with the latest Kubernetes versions and security tools based on the CKS curriculum.

## About This Project

The **K8s Security** site is structured into four main categories:

- **[Fundamentals](/docs/fundamentals/intro)**: Core security principles, authentication, authorization, and Kubernetes security models.
- **[Attack Vectors](/docs/attack_vectors/intro)**: Common security risks and real-world Kubernetes exploits.
- **[Best Practices](/docs/best_practices/intro)**: Essential steps to harden Kubernetes clusters, workloads, and network configurations.
- **[Tools](/docs/tools/intro)**: Open-source tools for scanning, monitoring, auditing, and enforcing Kubernetes security.

Each section provides **detailed security insights** with step-by-step **guides**, **code examples**, and **mitigation techniques**.
