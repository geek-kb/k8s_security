# Kubernetes Security Fundamentals

Understanding **Kubernetes security fundamentals** is essential for securing clusters against potential threats. This section provides a foundation for securing **Kubernetes authentication, authorization, and network controls**.

### Topics Covered

- **[Understanding Kubernetes Attack Surfaces](/docs/fundamentals/understanding_k8s_attack_surface)**: Learn how attackers target different layers of Kubernetes.
- **[Authentication and Access Control](/docs/fundamentals/k8s_security_primitives/authentication/authentication_methods)**: Secure API access using strong authentication mechanisms.
- **[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/fundamentals/k8s_security_primitives/authorization/rbac)**: Manage user and service permissions effectively.
- **[The Four C's of Cloud Native Security](/docs/fundamentals/the_4_c_cloud_native_security)**: Follow a layered security model to protect Kubernetes environments.

This section serves as a **starting point for learning Kubernetes security** and implementing foundational security practices.
