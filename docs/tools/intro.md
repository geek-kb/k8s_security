# Security Tooling for Kubernetes

Securing Kubernetes requires more than just applying best practices—it also involves using specialized tools to **detect misconfigurations, prevent supply chain risks, monitor runtime behavior, and audit compliance**. This section provides an overview of popular open-source tools used by Kubernetes security professionals, with a focus on **practical usage and integration** into real-world environments.

This list includes tools for vulnerability scanning, access control, runtime security, configuration auditing, and more. These tools are referenced throughout this site and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or deployed in production clusters to enhance visibility and reduce risk.

> If you're preparing for the **Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)** exam, many of these tools are either required or highly recommended. CKS-required tools will be marked accordingly in follow-up materials.

## Static Analysis and Image Scanning

Tools in this category analyze container images or Kubernetes configurations to find known vulnerabilities and insecure defaults.

### [Trivy](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/trivy)

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

A comprehensive vulnerability scanner for container images, Kubernetes YAML, Terraform, and more. It can detect OS and language-level CVEs, secrets, and misconfigurations.

### [Syft](/docs/best_practices/supply_chain_security/syft)

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

A tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) from container images or file systems. Useful for inventorying what goes into your containers.

### [Grype](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/grype)

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

A vulnerability scanner that works with Syft SBOMs to identify known CVEs in container images.

### [kube-score](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/configuration_validation/kube_score)

Performs static analysis of Kubernetes manifests, identifying insecure configurations, privilege issues, or lack of resource limits.

### [kubescape](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/configuration_validation/kubescape)

An end-to-end Kubernetes security testing tool that scans for misconfigurations and compliance with industry frameworks like NSA-CISA and MITRE ATT&CK.

### [Polaris](/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/configuration_validation/polaris)

Validates Kubernetes YAML files and live clusters against a set of security and reliability policies.

---

## Runtime Security and Threat Detection

These tools monitor your cluster during operation to detect abnormal behavior or unauthorized access.

### [Falco](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/falco)

**Required knowledge for the CKS certification.**

A runtime security tool that uses Linux kernel events to detect malicious behavior in containers, such as unexpected system calls, privilege escalations, or network activity.

### [Tetragon](/docs/best_practices/monitoring_logging_and_runtime_security/tetragon)

An eBPF-based runtime enforcement and visibility tool that can detect and block suspicious activity, with support for fine-grained process and network-level policies.

---

## Configuration Auditing and Compliance

These tools analyze running clusters or resource definitions to ensure they conform to security baselines.

### kube-bench

Runs automated checks against the Kubernetes CIS Benchmarks to assess control plane and node configurations.

### kube-hunter

Scans Kubernetes clusters for common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective.

### KubeAudit

A command-line tool that audits Kubernetes clusters for security compliance, especially around RBAC, pod specs, and resource configuration.

---

## Secrets Management

Managing secrets securely is critical in Kubernetes. The following tools help encrypt, audit, or safely inject secrets into your workloads.

### Sealed Secrets

An encryption tool by Bitnami that allows you to store encrypted Kubernetes secrets in Git safely. Decryption is handled by a controller in the cluster.

### Mozilla SOPS

Encrypts secrets in YAML/JSON files for use with GitOps workflows. Works well with KMS providers like AWS KMS, GCP KMS, or PGP.

---

## Supply Chain Security and SBOM

These tools help verify the integrity and origin of artifacts that make it into your cluster.

### Cosign

Part of the Sigstore project, Cosign allows signing and verifying container images, ensuring they have not been tampered with.

### Notation

An OCI-compliant tool for signing container images using Notary v2. Used in environments that follow stricter image provenance controls.

---

## Policy Enforcement and Admission Control

These tools allow defining and enforcing security policies across clusters during resource creation.

### OPA (Open Policy Agent) / Gatekeeper

Policy-as-code framework that allows enforcing custom rules at admission time, such as restricting privileged pods or requiring labels.

### Kyverno

A Kubernetes-native policy engine that allows validating, mutating, and generating resources without external dependencies.

---

## Network Security and Traffic Control

Monitoring and controlling traffic between Kubernetes services is essential for defense-in-depth.

### Cilium

An eBPF-powered networking and security platform that includes L3-L7 network policies, observability, and runtime enforcement.

### Calico

A popular networking and network policy engine that allows defining fine-grained ingress and egress controls.

---

## Observability and Forensics

Tools for gaining visibility into cluster behavior and responding to incidents.

### kubectl-snoop

A tool for gathering low-level syscall and performance information from nodes, useful during incident investigations.

### kubectl-trace

Allows running BPFtrace programs in Kubernetes clusters to trace kernel and application behavior.

---

## CI/CD and GitOps Security

### Conftest

Validates Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts using OPA policies as part of CI pipelines.

### Terrascan

Scans Terraform code and Kubernetes manifests for misconfigurations and policy violations.

---

## Conclusion

Using the right tools is crucial for securing Kubernetes across its entire lifecycle—from development and CI/CD to deployment and runtime. In this section, you’ll find detailed breakdowns of how these tools work, how to configure them securely, and how they support security best practices discussed throughout the site.
