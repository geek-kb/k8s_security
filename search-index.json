Pod Security Standards (PSS) define security guidelines for Kubernetes pods based on their security context. PSS replaced the deprecated Pod Security Policies (PSP) starting in Kubernetes v1.25 and became the standard enforcement mechanism. As of Kubernetes v1.34, PSS is the recommended approach for enforcing pod-level security. PSS categorizes security into three levels: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted. PSS enforcement is built directly into the Kubernetes API server and applies at the namespace level using admission control. For an overview of security best practices, refer to Cluster Setup and Hardening.","s":"Pod Security Standards (PSS) in Kubernetes","u":"/docs/best_practices/cluster_setup_and_hardening/pod_security/pod_security_standards/","h":"","p":1409},{"i":1413,"t":"The Privileged policy provides unrestricted access and allows all possible capabilities.
